# 🖊️ Todo App built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and Material UI

## This is a super simple Todo App built using React.js and styled using Material UI.

It uses the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage state, [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for design, [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for routing, [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store todos and Dark Mode support with [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/).

### You can view it here: https://maxtodos.netlify.app/

## 😃 You can:

- ➕ Add todo
- 🖊️ Edit todo
- 🗑️ Delete todo
- ↕️ Reorder the todos by dragging them
- 🕶️ Enable dark mode

## 🧠 Features in mind

- [ ] Use [Material UI's Dark Mode](https://material-ui.com/customization/palette/#user-preference)
- [ ] Set the dark mode as per user's system theme
- [ ] Improve the app using Lighthouse suggestions. More at [#22](https://github.com/max-programming/max-todos/issues/22)
